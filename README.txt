hear ye, hear ye
we are gathered 
here today to play
in the madness of 
the moon

and in the name of
Lunar the Third

I shall ask you to
stay in single file as
we borrow your 
souls for the 
remainder of the evening

may this be your
final reminder that
it is essential

to leave your souls
at the door before
entering the
garden of the
moon

handbags and 
hearts will be
searched, I repeat

handbags and
hearts shall be
searched
